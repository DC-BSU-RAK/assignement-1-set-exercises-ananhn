    <div class="reviews">
        <p>"The film is a good one, a perfect mixture of suspence, crime, thriller and investigation, and the film shows tragedy of rekha an aspiring actress who sadly lost her life in a cruel manner".-<em>Hanberry</em> </p>
        <p>"Unlike typical thrillers focused on finding the murderer, this film reveals the culprit early and shifts the focus to uncovering the motive.<br> Screenwriters drive the narrative at breakneck speed, keeping viewers hooked.<br> With 80s nostalgia and a fresh thriller approach, Rekha Chitram is a strong contender in Mollywood".-<em>Moimhd</em></p>
